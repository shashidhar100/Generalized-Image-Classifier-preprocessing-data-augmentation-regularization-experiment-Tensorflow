# Generalized-Image-Classifier-preprocessing-data-augmentation-regularization-experiment-Tensorflow
Performing the experiments on classifiers with different preprocessing ,data-augmentation and regularization techniques and also using different models and datasets
The file Classifier Experiments.ipynb has the experiment code and there are other supporting files like model.py,losses.py,metrics.py,utils.py Data_pipline.py the description about the Data_pipline is given [Here](https://github.com/shashidhar100/Custom-Image-Dataset-loader-in-Tensorflow-2)
# Experiments decription
* The new models can be added to model.py file and dictionary mapping in the class experiments in the
